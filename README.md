# Simple-Discord-Gift-Code-Generator
ONLY FOR EDUCATIONAL PURPOSES: This is a simple Discord gift-code-generator, it creates Discord gift-links and checks if they are valid. If they are, it prints the link or passes it to you via Discord webhook. It can't be used for stealing gift codes because the api adress where it checks if codes are real is very limited.


If you want to run the script and not the exe you might have to install some librays:
- pip install bs4
- pip install requests
